# pingstat

This is a small program which pings (currently hardcoded) hosts and provides some statistics on a REST endpoint.

## How does it work?
The program should be started as a systemd service. The munin plugin calls the endpoint and draws graphs from the statistics provided by the service.

## The code looks bad.
Thanks. This is my first time writing anything useful in Rust.
